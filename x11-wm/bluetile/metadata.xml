		Bluetile is a tiling window manager for Linux, designed to integrate
		with the GNOME desktop environment. It provides both a traditional,
		stacking layout mode as well as tiling layouts where windows are
		arranged to use the entire screen without overlapping. Bluetile tries
		to make the tiling paradigm easily accessible to users coming from
		traditional window managers by drawing on known conventions and
		providing both mouse and keyboard access for all features.
